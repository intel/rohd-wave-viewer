# ROHD Wave Viewer

ROHD Wave Viewer is a waveform viewer tool that built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework as part of the [ROHD](https://intel.github.io/rohd-website) ecosystem. It can be used in a browser, integrated as a Flutter widget, used as part of a debug stack which integrates it (e.g. ROHD DevTool Extension, eventually), or run as a native desktop application.  It can display waves passed via an API or read from a standard waveform file (e.g. VCD).

**Status:** This project is very much a work in progress and is not ready for production usage yet. Contributions are welcome!
