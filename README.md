ROHD Wave Viewer is a waveform viewer tool that built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. ROHD Wave Viewer can be used as browser based, desktop native, and mobile application waveform viewer.

The motivation behind this project comes from the discussion in <https://github.com/intel/rohd/discussions/418> where it aims to strengthen the verification capabilities in ROHD.
